# Code-Security-Authenitication

## Year 1 Programming Project 

### Description
- A security authentication program based on an access code.
- The access code is 4 single-digit integer numbers between 0-9.
- The program allows a user to enter a code, encrypt the number and compare it to an authorised access code.
- The program should also allow the user to decrypt an already encrypted code.
- All functions pass parameters using Pass by Reference.
- All reading and writing to/from arrays use pointer notation.
